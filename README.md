Description
===========

The `resty` command-line utility can be used to run OpenResty's Lua scripts directly off the command-line just like the `lua` or `luajit` command-line utilities. It can be used to create various command-line utilities using OpenResty Lua.

This tool works by creating a head-less `nginx` instance,
disabling [daemon](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#daemon), [master_process](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#master_process), [access_log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#access_log), and other things it does
not need. No `server {}` is configured hence *no* listening sockets
are involved at all.

The Lua code is initiated by the [init_worker_by_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua)
directive and run in the context of [ngx.timer](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat) callback. So all of
[ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme)'s Lua APIs available in the [ngx.timer](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat) callback context are
also available in the `resty` utility. We may remove some of the
remaining limitations in the future though.

Synopsis
========

    $ export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH

    $ which resty
    /usr/local/openresty/bin/resty

    $ resty -h
    resty [options] [lua-file [args]]

    Options:
        -c num              Set maximal connection count (default: 64).
        -e prog             Run the inlined Lua code in "prog".
        --help              Print this help.

        --http-include path Include the specified file in the nginx http configuration block
                            (multiple instances are supported).

        -I dir              Add dir to the search paths for Lua libraries.

        --main-include path Include the specified file in the nginx main configuration block
                            (multiple instances are supported).

        --resolve-ipv6      Make the nginx resolver lookup both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

        --nginx             Specify the nginx path (this option might be removed in the future).
        -V                  Print version numbers and nginx configurations.
        --valgrind          Use valgrind to run nginx
        --valgrind-opts     Pass extra options to valgrind

    For bug reporting instructions, please see:
    <http://openresty.org/#Community>

    $ resty -e 'print("hello")'
    hello

    $ time resty -e 'ngx.sleep(3) print("done\n")'
    done

    real 0m3.085s
    user 0m0.071s
    sys 0m0.010s

    $ resty -e 'ngx.say(ngx.md5("hello"))'
    5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

    $ resty -e 'io.stderr:write("hello world\n")' > /dev/null
    hello world

To run the code example in [lua-resty-mysql](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-mysql)'s
"Synopsis" documentation section:

    $ resty mysql-example.lua
    connected to mysql.
    table cats created.
    3 rows inserted into table cats (last insert id: 1)
    result: [{"name":"Bob","id":"1"},{"name":"","id":"2"},{"name":null,"id":"3"}]

where `mysql-example.lua` is from [lua-resty-mysql](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-mysql)'s docs.

Stdin also works (in addition to stdout and stderr):

    $ resty -e 'print("got: ", io.stdin:read("*l"))'
    hiya
    got: hiya

where the first "hiya" line was entered from the keyboard.

"Light threads" also work:

    $ time resty -e 'local ths = {}
                     for i = 1, 3 do
                         ths[i] = ngx.thread.spawn(function ()
                                      ngx.sleep(3) ngx.say("done ", i)
                                  end)
                     end
                     for i = 1, #ths do ngx.thread.wait(ths[i]) end'
    done 1
    done 2
    done 3

    real 0m3.073s
    user 0m0.053s
    sys 0m0.015s

User command-line arguments are also passed:

    $ resty -e 'print(arg[1], ", ", arg[2])' hello world
    hello, world

To check version numbers:

    $ resty -V
    resty 0.01
    nginx version: openresty/1.7.7.2
    built by gcc 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-7) (GCC)
    TLS SNI support enabled
    configure arguments: --prefix=/usr/local/openresty/nginx ...

Installation
============

The `resty` command-line utility is bundled and enabled in OpenResty 1.7.7.2+ by
default and is installed under `<openresty-prefix>/bin/` by default.
If the OpenResty prefix is the default value (`/usr/local/openresty`),
then you can just add `/usr/local/openresty/bin` to your PATH environment:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH
```

Test Suite
==========

This project comes with a test suite powered by Perl's testing toolchain.

To run the test suite on your side, first install some of the CPAN modules required by the test
scaffold:

```bash
sudo cpan Test::Base IPC::Run
```

Also, you need to make your nginx executable visible in your PATH environment:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/your/nginx/sbin:$PATH
```

Then you can run the tests with the `prove` command provided by Perl:

```bash
prove -r t
```

To run an individual test file, just specify the test file on the command-line, for instance,

```bash
prove t/resty/user-args.t
```

To run an individual test case in a test file, just (temporarily) add the line

```
--- ONLY
```

to the end of that test block, then run that particular test file as mentioned above.
