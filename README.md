Description
===========

The `resty` command-line utility can be used to run OpenResty's Lua scripts directly off the command-line just like the `lua` or `luajit` command-line utilities. It can be used to create various command-line utilities using OpenResty Lua.

This tool works by creating a head-less `nginx` instance,
disabling [daemon](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#daemon), [master_process](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#master_process), [access_log](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#access_log), and other things it does
not need. No `server {}` is configured hence *no* listening sockets
are involved at all.

The Lua code is initiated by the [init_worker_by_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua)
directive and run in the context of [ngx.timer](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat) callback. So all of
[ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme)'s Lua APIs available in the [ngx.timer](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat) callback context are
also available in the `resty` utility. We may remove some of the
remaining limitations in the future though.

Synopsis
========

```
$ export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH

$ which resty
/usr/local/openresty/bin/resty

$ resty -h
resty [options] [lua-file [args]]

$ resty -e 'print("hello")'
hello

$ time resty -e 'ngx.sleep(3) print("done\n")'
done

real 0m3.085s
user 0m0.071s
sys 0m0.010s

$ resty -e 'ngx.say(ngx.md5("hello"))'
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

$ resty -e 'io.stderr:write("hello world\n")' > /dev/null
hello world
```

To run the code example in [lua-resty-mysql](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-mysql)'s
"Synopsis" documentation section:

```
$ resty mysql-example.lua
connected to mysql.
table cats created.
3 rows inserted into table cats (last insert id: 1)
result: [{"name":"Bob","id":"1"},{"name":"","id":"2"},{"name":null,"id":"3"}]
```

where `mysql-example.lua` is from [lua-resty-mysql](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-mysql)'s docs.

Stdin also works (in addition to stdout and stderr):

```
$ resty -e 'print("got: ", io.stdin:read("*l"))'
hiya
got: hiya
```

where the first "hiya" line was entered from the keyboard.

"Light threads" also work:

```
$ time resty -e 'local ths = {}
                 for i = 1, 3 do
                     ths[i] = ngx.thread.spawn(function ()
                                  ngx.sleep(3) ngx.say("done ", i)
                              end)
                 end
                 for i = 1, #ths do ngx.thread.wait(ths[i]) end'
done 1
done 2
done 3

real 0m3.073s
user 0m0.053s
sys 0m0.015s
```

User command-line arguments are also passed:

```
$ resty -e 'print(arg[1], ", ", arg[2])' hello world
hello, world
```

If you need to use a shared dict:

```
$ resty --shdict='dogs 1m' -e 'local dict = ngx.shared.dogs
                               dict:set("Tom", 56)
                               print(dict:get("Tom"))'
56
```

To check version numbers:

```
$ resty -V
resty 0.01
nginx version: openresty/1.7.7.2
built by gcc 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-7) (GCC)
TLS SNI support enabled
configure arguments: --prefix=/usr/local/openresty/nginx ...
```

Installation
============

The `resty` command-line utility is bundled and enabled in OpenResty 1.7.7.2+ by
default and is installed under `<openresty-prefix>/bin/` by default.
If the OpenResty prefix is the default value (`/usr/local/openresty`),
then you can just add `/usr/local/openresty/bin` to your PATH environment:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/openresty/bin:$PATH
```

If you are using the official OpenResty
[pre-built Linux packages](https://openresty.org/en/linux-packages.html), you should install the
[openresty-resty](https://openresty.org/en/rpm-packages.html#openresty-resty) package and/or
the [openresty-doc](https://openresty.org/en/rpm-packages.html#openresty-doc) (or `openresty-restydoc` on
Debian/Ubuntu) package
since the [openresty](https://openresty.org/en/rpm-packages.html#openresty) binary package itself does not
contain the `resty` or `restydoc` utilities.

Test Suite
==========

This project comes with a test suite powered by Perl's testing toolchain.

To run the test suite on your side, first install some of the CPAN modules required by the test
scaffold:

```bash
sudo cpan Test::Base IPC::Run
```

Also, you need to make your nginx executable visible in your PATH environment:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/your/nginx/sbin:$PATH
```

Then you can run the tests with the `prove` command provided by Perl:

```bash
prove -r t
```

To run an individual test file, just specify the test file on the command-line, for instance,

```bash
prove t/resty/user-args.t
```

To run an individual test case in a test file, just (temporarily) add the line

```
--- ONLY
```

to the end of that test block, then run that particular test file as mentioned above.
